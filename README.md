# Statamic How To Addon

Would you like to use less time to explain how your specific Statamic site has been built? "How To" is your Statamic Addon then!

NEW: You can now add a widget of your videos to the dasboard.

## How does it work?

First of all, you need to make screen recordings on how your site works. This part only needs to be done once by yourself. I can't help you there.

Upload your videos, give them a name, and maybe a short description if you want. The addon will display all videos nicely and your clients can watch those videos over and over again. They just need to log in and enjoy your screencasts.
Your videos will be hosted on your client's server and he can't lose a link to them or anything similar. How great is that?

English and German translation is already provided, but you can easily add your specific translation to the addon.
