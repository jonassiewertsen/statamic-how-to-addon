# Statamic How To Addon

Would you like to use less time to explain how your specific Statamic site has been build? This is your Statamic Addon then!

## How does it work?

First of all, you need to make screen recordings, on how your site works. This part only needs to be done once by 
yourself. I can't help you there.

Upload your videos, give them a name and maybe a short description if you want. The addon will display all videos nicely 
and your clients can watch those videos over and over again, by just logging onto the control panel. 

Your videos will be hosted by the client himself and he cant lose a link to them or anything similar. How great is that?

English and German translation is already provided, but you can easily add your own translation to the addon.
